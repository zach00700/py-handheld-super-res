# Handheld Multi-Frame Super-Resolution Implementation in Python 

This is an attempt to implement the [Handheld Multi-Frame Super-Resolution](https://doi.org/10.1145/3306346.3323024) algorithm developed by Wronski et al. at Google research.

I was fascinated by the huge potential of this application for a fast and light resolution enhancement. 

I made this project in order to grapple with the concepts used in image enhancement, and also because I personally find hand-crafted algorithms beautiful.
